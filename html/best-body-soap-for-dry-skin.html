  <h2>
   Why All-Natural Soap? What’s Wrong with Commercial Soap?
  </h2>
  <p>
   <b>
   </b>
   Soapmaking was going great—the Babylonians were doing it as far back as2800 B.C.—until World War I, when commercial soap came into the picture. While synthetic ingredients helped to scale soap manufacturing so that bars could be mass-produced to treat soldiers’ wounds, the end product set the stage for soap to spiral into something it was never meant to become.
  </p>
  <p>
   The problem with commercial soap today is that beneficial, moisturizing glycerin is extracted and saved for higher-margin products, like lotions, creams, and salts. Big brands tend to treat soap like a bottom-of-the-barrel product, literally removing the good stuff before selling it to you. In place of natural glycerin, you’re getting non-natural fillers—some of which are potentially harmful.      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t even allow these types of products to be called “soap.” They’re instead defined as detergents, which brands often disguise as “body bars.” If you have ever used bar soap or a body bar and thought that it felt a little harsh on your skin, it was probably a detergent.
