        <p>During the first World War, <strong>Big Soap</strong> began stripping natural ingredients from soap to make production cheaper and faster. Men were forced to settle for boring name brand bars that dried out their skin and made them smell like chemical-based beasts. The term “natural soap” was as rare and mysterious as the Squatch himself.</p>

            <h3><span>The Squatch</span> Emerges...</h3>
            <p>Driven by a passion for all natural products and a realization that there were no companies out there making honest, all natural soap for dudes, our founder, Jack, began creating his own recipes out of his garage. After countless batches and hours spent perfecting the process, <strong>the Squatch bar</strong> emerged. A few friends tried it out…they loved it.</p>

            <p><strong>Great question!</strong> Maybe you’re not the “all natural” type of guy. Maybe you enjoy your generic brand name bar or like to rub down with liquid detergent every day. But the truth is, you’re not a dish, you’re a man, and as a man you have some skin in the game, and that skin craves natural, nourishing ingredients like the ones found in our products.</p>

    <h2>We Make Soap <span>The Right Way</span></h2>
    <p>We like to joke that our soap is square because <strong>we refuse to cut corners</strong>. It’s cheesy but it’s true – we use the traditional cold process for all of our soap to retain the glycerin and nutrients in each bar, without the need for harsh preservatives.  On top of that, all our products are made in the USA, so not only are you supporting your skin and your scent, you’re supporting America.</p>
