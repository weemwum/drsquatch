  <h2>
   Natural Soap Smells and Feels Better
  </h2>
  <p>
   Natural soap gets its scent from essential oils, which are believed to have many benefits ranging from healing skin conditions and reducing wrinkles to balancing hormones, soothing muscles, and even alleviating pain.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, commercial soaps have synthetic scents that are chemically unidentifiable to consumers. Cosmetics makers are not required by the FDA to make the public aware of the potentially thousands of non-natural add-ins they use to create certain fragrances. There is no transparency, and no sign that there ever will be. What we do know is that many manufactured scents are a mixture of carcinogens, neurotoxins, allergens, and other dangerous add-ins. Whenever you notice “fragrance” listed as an ingredient, it’s a concoction of chemicals. The only questions are how many of them are there and how harmful are they?
  </p>
  <h2>
   Why All-Natural Soap? What’s Wrong with Commercial Soap?
  </h2>
  <p>
   The problem with commercial soap today is that even if it smells good, the beneficial, moisturizing glycerin is extracted and saved for higher-margin products like lotions, creams, and salts. Big brands tend to treat soap like a bottom-of-the-barrel product, literally removing the good stuff before selling it to you. In place of natural glycerin, you’re getting non-natural fillers—some of which are potentially harmful.      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t even allow these types of products to be called “soap.” They’re instead defined as detergents, which brands often disguise as “body bars.” If you have ever used bar soap or a body bar and thought it felt a little harsh on your skin, it was probably a detergent.
